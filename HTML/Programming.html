		As of right now the only computer languages I know to a good extent are Python and HTML, although I am working on others such as CSS java and javascript. I took an intrest to computers as soon as they were introduced to me. When I was introduced it was mainly for video games, and today, games are still take a large part of my day. But when i discovered programming i was enthralled, javascript was the first thing i tried, i never learned much but it was enough to let me know that I was hooked. Soon after i decided javascript wasn't my thing I discovered Python, the website that i found talking about it labeled it as the "Video game language" so of course i was interested. And although you can make video games using python, there is so much more to what it really is. While i was working with python i discovered HTML and started learning that on the side, which is very useful for my website.
