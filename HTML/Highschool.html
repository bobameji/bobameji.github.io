		I'm only a Freshman in highschool, but I've managed stright A's throughout the past semester and a half and plan to do so until I
		graduate. I'm hoping to get into Carnegie Mellon or M.I.T for college, and major in Computer Science.<br>
		A friend of mine who in currently in college recently made a portfolio website for himself and urged me to do the same. He knew the plans I had for college and would like me to succeed, and he said that not many other freshmen in highschool do things like this. I felt up to the challenge and wanted to lean more of HTML and CSS, so i decided to start the project, and after some help from my friend, I managed to get started.
